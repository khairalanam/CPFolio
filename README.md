## Summary

CPFolio is a platform where the information about all the coding contests hosted by major competitive programming platforms like CodeChef, CodeForces, HackerRank etc, are gathered in one place. This helps students to find coding contests easily without the hassle of going through each platform and find them.

## Problem

* The idea of going through each platform, finding the contest for you, and repeating it for other platforms in case you couldn't find one, is a very tedious task.
* Students waste a lot of time just going through contests' information rather than actual preparations for the contests.

## Solution

* With CPFolio, one can easily find information on all the coding contests from different platforms in one place, making it an easy task.
* With CPFolio, students save a lot of time going through the information. Essential information like the host, start time, end time, etc keep students informed on the contests.
